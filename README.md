# Pendo

This package models Pendo data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/pendo). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/pendo#schemainformation).

This package enables you to better understand how users are experiencing and adopting your product. It does so by:
- Calculating usage of features, pages, guides, and the overall product at the account and individual visitor level
- Enhancing event stream tables with visitor and product information, referring pages, and features to track the customer journey through the application
- Creating daily activity timelines for features, pages, and guides that reflect their adoption rates, discoverability, and usage promotion efficacy
- Directly ties visitors and features together to determine activation rates, power-usage, and churn risk

## Models

This package contains transformation models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Pendo source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pendo_source). A dependency on the source package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. The primary outputs of this package are described below. Intermediate models are used to create these output models.  

| **model**                | **description**                                                                                                                                |

## Installation Instructions

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

```yml
# packages.yml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/pendo
    version: [">=0.2.0", "<0.3.0"]
```

## Configuration

By default, this package looks for your Pendo data in the `pendo` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Pendo data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  pendo_database: your_database_name
  pendo_schema: your_schema_name 
```

### Passthrough Columns

This package includes all of the source columns that are defined in the macros folder. We recommend including custom columns in this package because the transformation models only bring in the standard columns for the `EVENT`, `FEATURE_EVENT`, `PAGE_EVENT`, `ACCOUNT_HISTORY`, and `VISITOR_HISTORY` tables.

You can add more columns using our passthrough column variables. These variables allow the passthrough columns to be aliased (`alias`) and casted (`transform_sql`) if you want, although it is not required. You can configure the datatype casting using a SQL snippet within the `transform_sql` key. You may add the desired SQL snippet while omitting the `as field_name` part of the casting statement - we rename this column with the alias attribute - and your custom passthrough columns will be casted accordingly.

Use the following format for declaring the respective passthrough variables:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

vars:
  pendo__feature_event_pass_through_columns: # will be passed to pendo__feature_event and stg_pendo__feature_event
    - name:           "custom_crazy_field_name"
      alias:          "normal_field_name"
  pendo__page_event_pass_through_columns: # will be passed to pendo__page_event and stg_pendo__page_event
    - name:           "property_field_id"
      alias:          "new_name_for_this_field_id"
      transform_sql:  "cast(new_name_for_this_field as int64)"
    - name:           "this_other_field"
      transform_sql:  "cast(this_other_field as string)"
  pendo__account_history_pass_through_columns: # will be passed to pendo__account, pendo__feature_event, and pendo__page_event
    - name:           "well_named_field_1"
  pendo__visitor_history_pass_through_columns: # will be passed to pendo__visitor, pendo__feature_event, and pendo__page_event 
    - name:           "well_named_field_2"
  pendo__event_pass_through_columns: # will be passed to stg_pendo__event (in source package only)
    - name:           "well_named_field_3"
```

### Changing the Build Schema

By default, this package builds the Pendo final models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_pendo`), intermediate models in (`<target_schema>` + `_int_pendo`), and staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_stg_pendo`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled Pendo data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
  pendo:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
    intermediate:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
  pendo_source:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

> NOTE: If your profile does not have permissions to create schemas in your destination, you can set each `+schema` to blank. The package will then write all tables to your pre-existing target schema.
